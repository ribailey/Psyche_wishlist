# Psyche_wishlist
Code for creating sampling wishlists for the Psyche project. Updates at 0400 daily central European time. Uses "Outdated_raw_data" sheet to create the complete species list and to remove species recorded as having a published chromosome level assembly on that sheet plus any recorded as having non-zero sampling on the same sheet. Any species recorded on GOAT (via Psyche webpage) as collected, received by sequencing centre, in process, or at any more advanced stage, by Psyche or another organisation, are removed from wishlists. Any species present on the "upcoming_submissions" Google sheet is either removed from the wishlist (if at least one female is confirmed to have been sampled) or retained with a note in the wishlists if sampled but no female recorded. To remove a species from the wishlist, find one entry for it in "upcoming_submissions" (or add one if it's not already there) and either (a) add 'female' in the column 'Sex' for that entry, or add 'no' in the column 'More_sampling_needed'. This will remove it from all wishlists.
